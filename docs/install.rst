Installation
============

This fork of Manim runs on python 3.7 only. Earlier versions of python are not
supported. You can install the python dependencies with ``pip install -r
requirements.txt``.

manim relies on system libraries you will need to install on your operating
system:

* ffmpeg
* latex
* sox

The dockerfile is (should be) the definitive source for everything required by
``manim``.
